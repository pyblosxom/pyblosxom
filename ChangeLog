2003-04-22  Theodore W. Leung  <twl@dev>
	* Update conditionalhttp to work when comments are present

2003-04-20  Theodore W. Leung  <twl@dev>
	* Update autoping to use new pyblosxom internals

2003-04-20 Wari Wahab <wari at home dot wari dot org>
	* Added blog_encoding configuration, default set to iso-8859-1
	* Templates read are converted to unicode

2003-04-02 Wari Wahab <wari at home dot wari dot org>
	* Deprecated $tb, we have an almost working feedback plugin, and also
	  $tb is very much dependent on the MovableType Standalone Trackback
	  Tool, which has no business in pyblosxom land except for in a
	  plugin.
	* Removed $tb of course needs a $tb plugin replacement, hence the
	  standalonetrackbacktool.py (What a long name)

2003-04-01 Wari Wahab <wari at home dot wari dot org>
	* Definitely not an all fools day joke. Moved entryparsers to the much
	  cleaner and unified callback mechanisms. Callback added -
	  entryparser

2003-03-28 Wari Wahab <wari at home dot wari dot org>
	* Moved preformatters to be plugins. This is a much cleaner approach
	  then what have been done previously. Callbacks added - preformat and
	  postformat

2003-03-26 Will Guaraldi <willg at bluesock dot org>
	* Re-wrote the callback chain mechanisms so it's a passive
	  registration chain like blosxom and it's more magical and
	  versatile.

2003-03-24 Will Guaraldi <willg at bluesock dot org>
	* Adjusted initialize_plugins to load plugins in the plugins
	  directory in alphanumeric order if the "load_plugins" key
	  is not set in the config file.  Otherwise we load the plugins
	  in the "load_plugins" list in the order they're listed.

2003-03-21  Theodore W. Leung  <twl@dev>
	* Updated the lucene.py plugin to take configuration parameters 
          from config.py.  Added documentation
	* Updated the logstats.py plugin to take configuration parameters
	  from config.py.  
	* Added support for plugins in the BlosxomRenderer.  These plugins
	  are based on the Perl blosxom 2.0 callbacks. 

2003-03-11 Blake Winston (with some followup from Will Guaraldi)
        * Introduced the EntryBase API and adjusted the code base so that
	  content can be dynamically created from whatever is handling
	  the URL.

2003-03-01 Will Guaraldi <willg at bluesock dot org>
	* Changes initialize_plugins(...) to load plugins listed in
	  the "load_plugins" key in the config file.  If no "load_plugins"
	  key is set, then we don't load any plugins.  We load plugins
	  in the order of the "load_plugins" list.

2003-02-16 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Pyblosxom core rendering code can now use seperate renderers
	  defined by the user. This means that if a user wants to use other
	  templating system, it possible now. Possibilities includes renderers
	  using Cheetah, Albatross, empy templating system, or even
	  HTML Template that most perl users have known and love. Right now,
	  included renderers are the blosxom templating system and a debug
	  renderer
	* Updated most plugins to include renderers in their load mechanism so
	  that they can use it if needed.

2003-02-11 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Config.py no longer used an INI file, this will load faster than
	  having an INI file to parse
	* Updated config.py with values that reflect the current pyblosxom CVS
	  state.
	* py['tb_data'] no longer a default value in pyblosxom.py
	* Added a contrib/entryparsers/ directory and basically store what we
	  can handle over there. Users get a standard txt.py entryparser as
	  default
	* Added a modified version of autoping code from Sam Ruby that's cache
	  and entryparsers compliant. Sadly you need to modify one line in the
	  code that states where you you installed pyblosxom (This is not in
	  config)

2003-02-10 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Added ability for pyblosxom to read entries of different extensions,
	  given a proper extension driver, this means that if you associate
	  .doc files as word documents, and you have libs.entryparsers.doc.py
	  that handles word documents and fill up entryData with the
	  respective data that a template needs, then dropping in such
	  document is easy as creating an entry.
	  Other extensions planned would be XHTML and what nots. These
	  entryparsers do not need to use preformatters, the txt.py '.txt'
	  handler shows how you can use the cache and preformatters if you
	  need it (cache is necesary for slow entryparsers)
	* External utiliies can now use this mechanism to get the data they
	  need to get values from entries other than .txt

2003-02-08 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Totally restructured the way caching works now. Two types of cache
	  drivers now available, a file pickle (works like pyblosxom 0.6 but
	  you can specify a different directory to store files) and a driver
	  to cache data in a python shelve
	* Optimized pyblosxom.py to not read entries at all when data is
	  already cached

2003-02-07 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Fixed PATH_INFO data that was actually set when using cgiwrap even
	  if it's empty

2003-02-02 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg> pyblosxom 0.6
	* Released as version 0.6

2003-01-29 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Added configuration override feature in flavours. This allows users
	  to modify their main configuration based on the templates' needs.
	  There could be problems though is users change essential
	  configuration items like datadir. To activate this feature, simple
	  create a file called config.$flav where $flav is replaced by
	  whatever flavours the users are overriding the configuration. The
	  contents are key-value pairs, for example
	  ------
	  num_entries 9999
	  ------
	  This will change the value that was configured in config.py.

2003-01-27 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Fixed some ugly defaults in the example flavours

2003-01-22 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Changed the text/xml detection just in case someone wants to use
	  application/rss+xml as the content-type for rss feeds. This will
	  ensure that anything that ends with xml will be have the content
	  'sanitized' with escaped < & > for xml. See
	  http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1142.html for details

2003-01-15 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Modified 404_handler.py to work with new pyblosxom subsystem

2003-01-15 Will http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/me/
	* Split the plugin initializtion into two stages - initialization and
	  load.
	* Added an api module which holds things the plugin can register with
	  to receive specific event notices as well as become part of the
	  callback chains for manipulating data.
	* Added a filestats function to the tools module which wraps os.stat
	  as well as other members in the api.filestats callback chain.
	* Added a pyfilenamemtime module that examines file names and if they
	  match yyyy-mm-dd-HH-MM, then it fixes the mtime on the os.stat
	  tuple.
	

2003-01-09 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Cleanup some codes of the main pyblosxom.cgi
	* Remove conditionalHTTP and 404 error generator to be plugins (placed
	  in the contrib directory so users have to choice to include it in or
	  not)
	* Added weblogs.com and blo.gs pings plugin, also in the contrib
	  directory

2003-01-07 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Removed two files from the plugins directory because they are not
	  relevant to the new drop-in plugins architecture
	* Thanks to Will of http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/ I now have usable
	  drop-in plugin implementation. TODO: Some form of documentation for
	  plugins in the Wiki

2003-01-05 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Fixed directory recursion when depth is more than one
	* Made rendering of categories to work more like blosxom (Do not honor
	  num_entries)

2002-11-25 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Made Conditional HTTP as a user option

2002-11-23 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* 3rd Revision release
	* Changes in preformatters. All preformatters now resides in
	  libs/preformatters/ directory. The do not have the preformatter_
	  prefix in the filename anymore. Preformatters should still work
	  without changes except for the filename. If possible (for the
	  future) preformatters should subclass PreFormatterBase
	* Entry bugs fixed, if you set a date or category in PATH_INFO, you
	  should get a full list of entries other than just py['num_entries']
	* Support for Etag and Last-Modified. Should save some bandwidth here.
	  Unfortunately not a user definable option yet
	* Pyblosxom now generates 404 errors when a query returns no entries
	* Added 404_handler.py in contrib directory for users interested in
	  Funky Caching
	* Added an excellent preformatter from John Abe
	* Added a funky preformatter script by Abe Fettig
	* pyarchives.py is now located in libs/plugins/ directory, to clean up
	  distribution as well as for future expansion
	* added logRequest() method in libs/tools.py. Look at pyblosxom.py on
	  how to activate it (grep logRequest pyblosxom.py). This is useful if
	  you cannot get access to your own raw http logs. Log format is NCSA
	  httpd compatible, so you can use tools like webalizer to analyze
	  your log files.
	* NOT in this version - Fixes for Windows Webservers. See - 
	  http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/py_stuff/thingsTodo/pyblosxom_for_Win32_.html

	
2002-11-03 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* 2nd Revision release
	* Added fix to reading files that pyblosxom cannot read by Nick
	* Flavour Overrides implementation, requested by Wam and done by Nick
	* Default Parser implementation (by Nick as well)
	* Code splitup in bite sized chunks
	* You can add new variables just by using #var stuff in your entries,
	  useful for "who's responsible" in blogs
	* Pickles cache files, make pyblosxom really fast (Disabled by
	  default)
	* Improved date handling instead of a boring <span>, you can now use
	  divs, see date_header and date_footer in flavours (request and
	  partly coded by Juri Pakaste of Straw RSS parser tool)
	* Includes code to show Monthly archives (see pyarchives.py)
	  enabled by:
	        from libs import pyarchives
		          self.py['archivelinks'] =
		pyarchives.genLinearArchive(self.py['datadir'],
			  self.py['base_url'])
	  so you can use $archivelinks in your flavours. Comment out the two
	  lines in libs/pyblosxom.py to disable
	* Murdered more bugs too minor to list out
			   

2002-09-15 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* 1st Revision Release - pyblosxom 0+5i_rev1
	
	* Fixed sorting mechanism so that it's blagg compatible
	
	* New $tags to support better permalinks, these are:
	$base_url      - URL of pyblosxom
	$file_path     - Path right up to the filename, without .txt extension
	$absolute_path - Directory name without filename attached

	* ESF format added in by default:
	See http://www.aquarionics.com/nodes/view.php?name=esf

	* Links to posts now supports full pathname + flavour:
	eg: http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/category/filename.flavour
	Where flavour is html, rss3, esf or many others possible with
	templates

	* Supports caching of pages that uses a preformatter (Disabled by default):
	This speeds up rendering the pages especially if the preformatters are
	very show.

	* Configuration using Windows style INI:
	Really helps if you upgrade pyblosxom a lot and hate changing data in
	the code, just edit *configFile* variable to point to your INI file

	* XML-RPC interface, supports bloggerAPI:
	Disabled by default, requires the blogs directory to be writable by
	the webserver, different categories shows up as differing blogIDs,
	tested with w.bloggar and jericho
	
2002-09-15 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* Initial Release - pyblosxom 0+5i
