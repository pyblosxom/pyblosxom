 Upgrading Pyblosxom
=====================

This walks through upgrading Pyblosxom from a previous version.


Before upgrading
================

First, read through the What's New documentation which includes
pointers to users and plugin developers regarding changes between
older versions and newer versions.

.. only:: text

   This is in the ``WHATSNEW`` file.

.. only:: html

   This is at :ref:`whatsnew`.

To be safe, install Pyblosxom locally (as opposed to on the server or
over your existing blog) and test your blog configuration and plugins
to make sure everything works with the new version.


Upgrading site-wide
===================

Using `pip`_::

    pip install --upgrade pyblosxom

**OR** Using `easy_install`_::

    easy_install -U pyblosxom


.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
.. _easy_install: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools


Upgrading in a virtual environment
==================================

First, activate your virtual environment, then use either pip or
easy_install as above.
