 TODO
======

This is a really high-level todo list.  Nothing here is written in
stone--this is mostly just a collection of thoughts.  As such, not
everything in here will make sense to implement.  Each item really
needs fleshing out before decisions on implementation should be made.

Before launching into anything, check the SVN repository which has the
latest version of this TODO list.

If you're inspired by any of these tasks, let us know on the
pyblosxom-devel mailing list.

If there are items not mentioned here, let us know on the
pyblosxom-devel mailing list.

Thanks!


MILESTONE VERSION 1.5
=====================

CODE CLEANUP

 - port over code cleanup from experimental

UNIT TESTING

 - add more tests

MANUAL

 - re-work this, use sphinx, tie documentation with api docs

COMMAND-LINE

 - port over command line changes from experimental
 - re-work command line handling to be more like git


MILESTONE VERSION 1.4
=====================

Prospective release date: 

UNIT TESTING

 - Look at the Cheesecake system and use something similar so that we
   have some basic tests we can run that test the whole system.

MANUAL

 - Go through and fill in more FIXMEs.
 - Need to add installation instructions for PyBlosxom as WSGI middleware.
 - Convert to reST.

PYBLOSXOM-CMD

 - Finish up pyblosxom-cmd so that it's a good alternative to running
   pyblosxom.cgi.


ANYTHING ELSE?

 - Paste support.



PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
======================

UNIT TESTING

 - We need additional unit and functional tests.  Part of the testing
   framework is in as of PyBlosxom 1.4.  This needs to be fleshed out.

MANUAL

 - Go through and clarify the config.py properties if we haven't already
   and provide examples in the PyBlosxom Manual.
 - Need to take out a lot of the blah blah blah content and clean up
   the language so it's clearer with more examples.  Also look at trimming
   text if possible.
 - Need to add installation instructions for PyBlosxom with SCGI/FCGI with 
   flup.
 - Need to add installation instructions for PyBlosxom for IIS.
 - Need to add information on migrating entries from other blog systems
   (Drupal?  WordPress?  LiveJournal? ...) to PyBlosxom.
 - Add instructions for PyBlosxom with FastCGI.
 - Add instructions for servers with multiple users (look at Martin Kraaft's 
   stuff).


PYBLOSXOM
=========

DATA CACHING

 - build a global caching mechanism that dumps old data?  look at 
   memcache?

CONFIGURATION DEFAULTS

 - Defaults for config.py variables need to be centralized somewhere,
   copied, and then updated with whatever is in config.py.  This should
   be done instead of get defaults floating across the codebase.

 - We should look into setting defaults to sane values allowing PyBlosxom
   to run with no config.py file at all.

PATH AND ABSOLUTE PATH

 - For each entry, we calculate $path and $absolute_path.  Why do
   we have both of them?  Are there inherent differences between the
   two?  What does blosxom do?

   Regardless, it looks like $path behaves differently in 1.3 than
   in previous versions.

WINDOWS

 - Does PyBlosxom currently work in Windows?

MAC OSX

 - Does PyBlosxom currently work in Mac OSX?

PYTHON VERSIONS

 - Which versions of Python do PyBlosxom work in?

CONFIGURATION

 - The Debian package (it might not do this anymore) assumes that
   config.py is a site-wide configuration file rather than a user-specific
   configuration file.  MoinMoin has both a site-wide configuration file
   and a user-specific (well...  wiki-specific) configuration file.

   Need to look into how they did their stuff and look into changing our
   configuration system to do something similar.

MTIMES

 - pyblosxom-cmd should go through the datadir and export the mtimes for
   all files (by calling cb_filestat) into a file index
   (There's an rdate module that copies mtimes into the entries.  We
   might want to fold this functionality into pyblosxom-cmd.)
 - adjust pyblosxom so that it looks for the file index cache before
   the default of stating the file

TEMPLATES

 - Flavours are specific to the blosxom rendering engine that PyBlosxom
   has.  It's about time we add other rendering engines.  For example,
   Myghty, Cheetah, ...  This might make it easier/more-useful for
   using PyBlosxom inside of a TurboGears or a Pylons application.

FLAVOUR FILES

 - We still have one problem with making flavour files easy to use and
   install: resources.  If a flavour file requires a .css file or images 
   or something like that, it needs to be handled outside of PyBlosxom
   by the web-server.  That makes documentation a mild pain in the ass
   and makes it harder to explain in a generic sense how to install
   flavour files.  It'd be cool if there was a way to specify whether
   a given resource belonged to a specific flavour and if so allow
   PyBlosxom to serve that resource (with the correct mime-type) from
   the flavour's flavour directory.

I18N

 - Are we internationalization friendly?  I think parts of the PyBlosxom
   system are, but we've got an awful lot of English strings in there.
   We should look at Internationalizing the error messages and other
   messages as well.  This might include internationalizing the flavour
   files--but I'm not entirely sure how that would work.

TAGS

 - There are a series of tags/folksonomy kinds of plugins now.  All of
   these (at least, last time I looked) suffer the problem that tags
   get stored inside the entry file and we don't open up and read the
   entry file until after we know we're going to render it.
 - This might be something we want to address inside of PyBlosxom.

STORAGE

 - Walk is less than optimal.  We should probably split it into a couple
   of different functions with hooks allowing for other data persistence
   methods.  This should make the API easier to use in regards to entries
   and it'll allow us to optimize the functions using caching more easily.
 - how many plugins use Walk?  for what purposes?
