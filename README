Summary
=======

PyBlosxom is a file-based blogging system in the spirit of Blosxom.
PyBlosxom uses directory tree to represent the category hierarchy.
All entries in a PyBlosxom blog are text files where the first
line is the title of the blog entry and the rest is the body of
the entry.

PyBlosxom isn't for everyone and it won't scale well if you have
a million entries.

PyBlosxom runs as a CGI script.  It also runs as a WSGI application
and it probably runs fine under mod_python, though this is less 
well-tested.

PyBlosxom supports flavours to change the look and feel of your blog.

PyBlosxom supports plugins to modify the existing default behavior.


How to install PyBlosxom
========================

Look at the ``install_*.txt`` documents in the ``docs/`` directory.
Pick the one that matches the kind of installation you're looking
for.

If you're upgrading PyBlosxom versions, read ``CHANGELOG`` which will
describe the differences between PyBlosxom versions and point out
things that you'll need to do when upgrading from one version to
the next.


How to find comprehensive documentation
=======================================

There's a series of text files in the docs/ directory which comprise
the current state of the PyBlosxom manual at the time of this release.

The most current version of the manual can be found on the `PyBlosxom
web-site <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`_ .
