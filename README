Changes between 1.0 and 1.1
===========================

Pertinent to users:
-------------------

1. We no longer include contributed plugins and flavours.  To find
   plugins and flavours, go to the PyBlosxom registry located at:

   http://www.planetpyblosxom.org/

2. We changed how num_entries is handled internally.  If num_entries
   is set to 0, the blosxom default file handler will display all
   the entries.  If num_entries is set to a positive number, then
   the blosxom default file handler will display at most that many
   entries.


Pertinent to developers and plugin developers:
----------------------------------------------

1. Plugins that implement cb_filelist are now in charge of adjusting
   the number of entries to be displayed based on the num_entries
   configuration variable.  This is no longer done in the renderer.


Changes between 0.9 and 1.0
===========================

Pertinent to users:
-------------------

1. We ditched "blosxom_custom_flavours"--you can remove it from your 
   config.py file.

2. We added static rendering--see the howto on the wiki.

3. Rewrote comments to use the new handler system.  You should replace
   the comments, pingbacks, trackbacks, and other comments-oriented
   plugins with the new versions from contrib/plugins/comments/

4. pingbacks plugin is now xmlrpc_pingbacks.py .

5. Adjusted the default templates for HTML and RSS.  Removed all other
   default templates.  Look at the flavour_examples directory for
   flavour examples.

6. Added an "ignore_properties" property to config.py which allows you to
   specify which directories in your datadir should be ignored.  For
   example:

     py["ignore_directories"] = ["CVS", ".svn"]

7. Added a template variable "pyblosxom_version" which points to
   pyblosxom/Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.VERSION_DATE .

8. Fixed some code in pyarchives so it worked with Python 2.1.
   Thanks to Wilhelm.

9. Fixed template retrieving code so that you can specify templates
   to use for a given category or parent categories.  Thanks to Nathan 
   for fixing this.

10. We added a "logdir" property to config.  PyBlosxom (and plugins) will
    create logs in this directory so the directory has to have write
    access for whatever user the webserver uses to run the script.


Pertinent to developers and plugin developers:
----------------------------------------------

1. Rewrote the startup for PyBlosxom request handling--we ditched
   the common_start function and picked up a common initialize
   function.

2. Unhardcoded where contrib and web files go when doing a multi-user
   installation using "python setup.py install".

3. Adjusted the comments plugin so that if a given entry has a "nocomments"
   property, then it won't get comments.

4. Moved the Request object into pyblosxom/Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py .

5. Fixed variable parsing so that if the variable value is a function that
   takes arguments, we pass the request in as the first argument.

6. Added VERSION, VERSION_DATE, and VERSION_SPLIT.  This allows you to
   verify that your plugin works with the version of PyBlosxom the user
   is using.
