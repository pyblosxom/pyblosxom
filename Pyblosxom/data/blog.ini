# Pyblosxom config properties can be set after this point if you
# like.  Or you can set them in the config.py file.  Setting things
# here overrides what's in your config.py file.  This makes it easier
# to have a development and a production blog--you just have a .ini
# file for each one.

# Example of setting a property:
# blog_title = Joe's Blog
