Summary
=======

This chapter covers a bunch of useful things to know when writing
PyBlosxom plugins.  This chapter, moreso than the rest of this manual,
is very much a work in progress.

FIXME - absorb from wiki, Will's tips, and tutorials


Things that all plugins should have
===================================

Documentation
-------------

All plugins should have a docstring at the top of the file that describes
in detail:

1. what the plugin does
2. how to install it
3. how to configure it
4. the license the plugin is distributed under
5. and any copyright information you have
6. any notes about requirements (e.g. "Requires Python 2.3 or greater")

For example, this is at the top of Will's wbgpager plugin::

   """
   Quickly written plugin for paging long index pages.  

   PyBlosxom uses the num_entries configuration variable to prevent
   more than num_entries being rendered by cutting the list down
   to num_entries entries.  So if your num_entries is set to 20, you
   will only see the first 20 entries rendered.

   The wbgpager overrides this functionality and allows for paging.
   It does some dirty stuff so that PyBlosxom doesn't cut the list down
   and then wbgpager cuts it down in the prepare callback later down
   the line.

   To install wbgpager, do the following:

     1. add "wbgpager" to your load_plugins list variable in your
        config.py file--make sure it's the first thing listed so
        that it has a chance to operate on the entry list before
        other plugins.
     2. add the $page_navigation variable to your head or foot
        (or both) templates.  this is where the page navigation
        HTML will appear.


   Here are some additional configuration variables to adjust the 
   behavior:

     wbgpager_count_from
       datatype:       int
       default value:  0
       description:    Some folks like their paging to start at 1--this
                       enables you to do that.

     wbgpager_previous_text
       datatype:       string
       default value:  &lt;&lt;
       description:    Allows you to change the text for the prev link.

     wbgpager_next_text
       datatype:       string
       default value:  &gt;&gt;
       description:    Allows you to change the text for the next link.

     wbgpager_linkstyle
       datatype:       integer
       default value:  0
       description:    This allows you to change the link style of the paging.
                       style 0:  [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... >>
                       style 1:  Page 1 of 4 >>


   That should be it!


   Note: This plugin doesn't work particularly well with static rendering.
   The problem is that it relies on the querystring to figure out which
   page to show and when you're static rendering, only the first page
   is rendered.  This will require a lot of thought to fix.  If you are
   someone who is passionate about fixing this issue, let me know.

Metadata
--------

All plugins should have the following module-level variables defined in them 
just after the docstring:

* ``__author__`` - This holds your name and email address so that people 
  can contact you when they have problems.

* ``__version__`` - This holds the version number and release date so that 
  people know what version of the plugin they're looking at.

* ``__url__`` - This holds the url where people can find information about 
  your plugin and documentation and download new versions of your plugin.

* ``__description__`` - This is a one-sentence description of what your 
  plugin does.


For example::

   __author__      = "Will Guaraldi - willg at bluesock dot org"
   __version__     = "version 1.5 2006-01-15"
   __url__         = "http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/pyblosxom/"
   __description__ = "Splits long indexes into multiple pages."



Configuration/installation verification
---------------------------------------

After that, you should have a ``verify_installation`` function that verifies 
that the plugin is configured correctly.  As of PyBlosxom 0.9, PyBlosxom
allows users to test their configuration and installation from the console.

In PyBlosxom 0.9 through 1.4.3, users did this by executing the 
``pyblosxom.cgi`` script::

   % ./pyblosxom.cgi
   Trying to import the config module....
   PyBlosxom version: 1.4.3-rc1 12/11/2007
   Welcome to PyBlosxom's installation verification system.
   ------
   ]] printing diagnostics [[
   pyblosxom:   1.4.3-rc1 12/11/2007
   ....

In PyBlosxom 2.0, users can do this either using the ``pyblosxom.cgi`` 
script::

   % ./pyblosxom.cgi --test
   Trying to import the config module....
   PyBlosxom version: 2.0 dev
   Welcome to PyBlosxom's installation verification system.
   ------
   ]] printing diagnostics [[
   pyblosxom:   2.0 dev
   ...


or using the ``pyblcmd`` script::

   % pyblcmd -c /home/joe/cgi-bin/config.py --test
   Trying to import the config module....
   PyBlosxom version: 2.0 dev
   Welcome to PyBlosxom's installation verification system.
   ------
   ]] printing diagnostics [[
   pyblosxom:   2.0 dev
   ...


This goes through and verifies the properties in the ``config.py`` file as
best as it can.  It also prints out diagnostic information which is useful
when things don't work.  It also loads and initalizes all the plugins and 
asks them to verify their configuration as well.

As a plugin developer, you should add a ``verify_installation`` function
to your plugin module.  Something like this (taken from pycategories)::

   def verify_installation(request):
       config = request.getConfiguration()

       if not config.has_key("category_flavour"):
           print "missing optional config property 'category_flavour' "
           print "which allows you to specify the flavour for the category "
           print "link.  refer to pycategory plugin documentation for more "
           print "details."
       return 1


This gives you (the plugin developer) the opportunity to walk the user 
through configuring your highly complex, quantum-charged, turbo plugin 
in small baby steps without having to hunt for where their logs might be.

So check the things you need to check, print out error messages (informative 
ones) using ``print``, and then return a 1 if the plugin is configured 
correctly or a 0 if it's not configured correctly.

Note: This is not a substitute for the user to read the installation 
instructions.  It should be a really easy way to catch a lot of potential 
problems without involving the web server's error logs and debugging 
information being sent to a web-browser and things of that nature.

Here's an example of verify_installation from Will's wbgpager plugin::

   def verify_installation(request):
       config = request.getConfiguration()
       if config.get("num_entries", 0) == 0:
           print "missing config property 'num_entries'.  wbgpager won't do "
           print "anything without num_entries set.  either set num_entries "
           print "to a positive integer, or disable the wbgpager plugin."
           print "see the documentation at the top of the wbgpager plugin "
           print "code file for more details."
           return 0

       return 1



How to log messages to a log file
=================================

First you need to get the logger instance.  After that, you can call 
debug, info, warning, error and critical on the logger instance.  For 
example::

   from pyblosxom import tools

   def cb_prepare(args):
      ...
      logger = tools.getLogger()
      logger.info("blah blah blah...")

      try:
         ...
      except Exception, e:
         logger.error(e)



How to store plugin state between callbacks
===========================================

The easiest way to store state between callbacks is to store the data
in the data dict of the Request object.  For example::

   STATE_KEY = "myplugin_state"

   def cb_date_head(args):
      request = args["request"]
      data = request.getData()

      if data.has_key(STATE_KEY) and data[STATE_KEY]["blah"] == "blahblah":
         ...


   def cb_filelist(args):
      request = args["request"]
      data = request.getData()

      data[STATE_KEY] = {}
      data[STATE_KEY]["blah"] = "blahblah"



How to implement a callback
===========================

If you want to implement a callback, you add a function corresponding
to the callback name to your plugin module.  For example, if you wanted
to modify the Request object just before rendering, you'd implement
cb_prepare like this::

   def cb_prepare(args):
       pass


Obviously, since we have ``pass`` we're not actually doing anything
here, but when the user sends a request and PyBlosxom handles it, 
this function in your plugin will get called when PyBlosxom runs the 
prepare callback.

Each callback passes in arguments through a single dictionary.  Each
callback passes in different arguments and expects different return
values.  Check the architecture chapter for a list of all the callbacks
that are available, their arguments, and return values.



Writing an entryparser
======================

Entry parsing functions take in a filename and the Request object.
They then open the file and parse it out.  The can call cb_preformat and 
cb_postformat as they see fit.  They should return a dict containing at 
least "title" and "story" keys.  The "title" should be a single string.  
The "story" should be a list of strings (with \n at the end).

Here's an example code that reads .plain files which have the title as 
the first line, metadata lines that start with # and then after all the 
metadata the body of the entry::

   import os

   def cb_entryparser(entryparsingdict):
       """
       Register self as plain file handler
       """
       entryparsingdict['plain'] = parse
       return entryparsingdict

   def parse(filename, request):
       """
       We just read everything off the file here, using the filename as
       title
       """
       entrydata = {}

       f = open(filename, "r")
       lines = f.readlines()
       f.close()

       # strip off the first line and use that as the title.
       title = lines.pop(0).strip()
       entrydata['title'] = title

       # absorb meta data lines which begin with a # and consist
       # of a name and a value
       while lines and lines[0].startswith("#"):
           meta = lines.pop(0)
           meta = meta[1:].strip()     # remove the hash
           meta = meta.split(" ", 1)
           entrydata[meta[0].strip()] = meta[1].strip()

       # join the rest of the lines as the story
       story = ''.join(lines)
       entrydata["story"] = "".join(lines)

       return entrydata



Writing a preformatter plugin
=============================

FIXME - need more about preformatters here

A typical preformatter plugin looks like this::

   def cb_preformat(args):
       if args['parser'] == 'linebreaks':
           return parse(''.join(args['story']))

   def parse(text):
       # A preformatter to convert linebreak to its HTML counterpart
       text = re.sub('\\n\\n+','</p><p>',text)
       text = re.sub('\\n','<br />',text)
       return '<p>%s</p>' % text
