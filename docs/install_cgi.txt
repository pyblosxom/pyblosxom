Summary
=======

While there are many ways to install PyBlosxom, the most common one is
to install PyBlosxom as a CGI script for a single user.  This
installation guide will cover that.  For other ways to install
PyBlosxom, refer to the docs directory, mailing lists and the `web-site`_.

This installation assumes you have some understanding of CGI, Apache
configuration, and know how to manipulate files and directories.  If
this doesn't sound like you, maybe you should get a friend to help out
or ask for help on the pyblosxom-users mailing list.  Details of the
mailing list are on our web-site on the `Contact us`_ page.

.. Note::

   A note about upgrading PyBlosxom:
    
   If you are upgrading your version of PyBlosxom, follow the
   instructions here and also read the ``README`` that comes with
   your PyBlosxom tarball for differences between this version and
   the previous versions.  The ``README`` file contains instructions
   on updating your ``config.py`` file, templates, and other parts of
   your PyBlosxom installation which you will have to do by hand.



Pre-requisites for installing PyBlosxom
=======================================

You will need:

* a web-server that runs CGI
* Python version 2.2 or later
* a text editor (notepad, vi, emacs, nano, ...) 

Additionally, if you are running PyBlosxom on Windows, you will 
also need:

* Python for Windows extensions: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/


Downloading
===========

You can find versions of PyBlosxom by going to the Download link at
http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/ .

Download the latest PyBlosxom ``.tar.gz`` file.


Installing PyBlosxom
====================

Installing PyBlosxom should take 5-10 minutes depending on what state
your system is currently in.  The installation consists of seven
steps.  Tweaking, styling, and adding content to your blog is covered
afterwards and in other parts of the documentation.


Untar
-----

Create a working temporary directory, move the PyBlosxom tar ball 
into it, and then untar the tar ball (something like 
``tar -xzvf pyblosxom.version.tar.gz``).


Install as library or not
-------------------------

There are two ways to install PyBlosxom on your system:

1. You can install PyBlosxom as a Python library.  To do this, change
   directory into the pyblosxom directory and run::

      python setup.py install

   After you do this, PyBlosxom will be installed as a Python library
   and you can move on to *Setting up a blog*.

2. If you don't want to or can't install PyBlosxom as a Python library,
   just untar it into your directory and be sure to follow the instructions
   on setting the ``codebase`` parameter later.



Setting up a blog
-----------------

To set up a blog do the following:

1. Copy the ``config.py`` and ``pyblosxom.cgi`` files from the ``web/`` 
   directory into your ``cgi-bin/`` directory or some directory that 
   has CGI permissions.

2. First create a directory for holding all your PyBlosxom files.
   Call this directory ``myblog/`` and put it in your userdir.

   Then create a sub-directory ``entries/`` under ``myblog/``.

   The entries for your blog are text files in your datadir.  The 
   datadir can contain directories each of which will be a category 
   for PyBlosxom.  In general, it's good to use one-word names that
   don't have spaces or punctuation in them for your directories.

   Then create a sub-directory ``flavours/`` under ``myblog/``.

   Flavours are collections of template files for a single look and
   feel for your blog.  You can store these flavours in the flavourdir.

   Then create a sub-directory ``plugins/`` under ``myblog/``.

   This directory will hold plugins that augment and extend the
   PyBlosxom's default behavior to meet your specific needs.

   The resulting tree would look like this (if your name was joe)::

      /home/joe/
         |- myblog/
              |- entries/
              |- flavours/
              |- plugins/


3. Open the ``config.py`` file up in your favorite editor.  Go through 
   and change the values of the configuration settings according to 
   the instructions in the ``config.py`` file.

   Make sure to set:

   * the ``datadir`` property to the datadir directory you created, 
   * the ``flavourdir`` property to the flavourdir directory you created, 
   * the ``plugins_dir`` property to the plugins directory you created,
   * and ``load_plugins`` to the empty list ``[ ]``.


   .. Note::

      If you did NOT install PyBlosxom as a Python library, then you must
      also set the ``codebase`` property to the directory you untarred 
      PyBlosxom into.  This should be the directory that holds the 
      ``Pyblosxom`` directory (note the case!).


   Plugins will require you to add new variables to your ``config.py``
   file in order to direct the plugin's behavior.  Additionally, you 
   can add variables to your ``config.py`` and these variables will be 
   available to you in your flavour templates.

4. You want to verify that your blog is set up correctly.  Change directory
   into your ``cgi-bin`` directory and run from the command line::

      ./pyblosxom.cgi


   PyBlosxom will go through a series of checks on your ``config.py`` 
   file to make sure that things are set up correctly and that required
   properties are set.

   If there are any problems, follow the instructions that it gives you.

   .. Note::

      Because you're running this check from the command line, there
      could still be problems with your setup.  However, if you get
      through the verify step, then it's likely any further problems
      are related to your web-server setup and whether it can execute
      pyblosxom.cgi.
      

5. Now it's time to write your first post and test your blog.  Change 
   directories to your datadir, launch your favorite editor and create 
   a file called ``firstpost.txt``.  Copy the following text into it::

       This is my first post
       <p>
           This is my first post with PyBlosxom.
       </p>


   The first line "First Post" becomes the title of the blog entry. 
   The date of the blog entry is the mtime on the file.  The body of 
   the blog entry starts with the HTML paragraph tag in the second 
   line and extends to the end paragraph tag in the last line.  Your 
   blog entries can be as long as you want.  The first line is plain 
   text--everything after that is HTML.

   .. Note::

      If you want to use a different markup like reST or Textile or 
      Moinmoin or something like that, see the documentation on 
      *Writing Entries* for how to set that up.


   Open up a web-browser and go to the URL
   ``http://your_server_here/path/to/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi``

   If you're running GNU/Linux with Apache and you have user folders
   set up and your username was ``joe``, then the url for your PyBlosxom
   blog might be something like this::
   
      http://www.joe.com/~joe/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi


   If everything is configured correctly, you should see your first
   post rendered with the default HTML flavour.  If not, you'll either
   see a Python stack trace or a message along the lines of Internal
   Server Error.  See below for help on trouble-shooting.



Trouble-shooting
================

We're going to try to break this down a bit into categories.  Bear
with us and keep trying things.  If you have problems and have gone
through this section to no avail, then come talk to us on the
`Pyblosxom users list`_.  Details of the mailing list are located at
our `Contact us`_ page.

.. _Pyblosxom users list: mailto:pyblosxom-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Running ./pyblosxom.cgi doesn't work
------------------------------------

First, you should check to see if you have Python installed on your
system.  If not, then please install Python.

If Python is installed on your system, make sure the first line in
``pyblosxom.cgi`` points to your Python interpreter.  If not, fix that
and try running ``./pyblosxom.cgi`` again.

If Python is installed on your system and the first line of
``pyblosxom.cgi`` is correct, then check for permissions issues:
``pyblosxom.cgi`` is a script--so it needs execute permission
in order to function.  If those aren't set, then fix that and try
running ``./pyblosxom.cgi`` again.


I see a HTTP 404 error when I try to bring up my blog
-----------------------------------------------------

When you try to look at your blog and you get a HTTP 404 error, then
you're using the wrong URL.  Are you futzing with ``.htaccess``?  Does
your server allow you to run CGI scripts?  Do other CGI scripts work?
Does the URL you're trying to use to access PyBlosxom look like other
URLs that work on your system?


I see a HTTP 500 error when I try to bring up my blog
-----------------------------------------------------

.. Note::

   Please read the installation chapter:
    
   At this point, running ``./pyblosxom.cgi`` at the command prompt
   should work fine.  If you haven't done that and you're busy
   trouble-shooting, go back to the *installation guide* and make
   sure you did all the steps.


When you try to look at your blog in a web-browser and get a HTTP 500 error, 
the first thing you should do is uncomment the line in ``pyblosxom.cgi`` 
(remove the # at the beginning of the line) that looks like this::

   #import cgitb; cgitb.enable()

so that it looks like this::

   import cgitb; cgitb.enable()

Then refresh the page in your browser.  If the problem is with PyBlosxom
and not your web-server, then you should see a pretty traceback that will
help you figure out what the specific problem is.

If it doesn't make any sense to you, you can copy and paste that into
an email to the pyblosxom-users mailing list and we're in a better position
to help you out.

If you don't see a traceback, then you either have a configuration problem
with your web-server or a configuration problem with Python.  The first
thing you should do is check your web-server's error logs.  For Apache, 
look for the ``error.log`` file in a place like ``/var/logs/apache`` or 
``/var/logs/httpd``.

Does the account your web-server runs as have execute access to your
``pyblosxom.cgi`` script?  If your web-server does not have the permissions
to read and execute your pyblosxom.cgi script, then your blog will not
work.

Do you have plugins loaded?  If you do, try unloading all your plugins
and see if the problem persists.  Sometimes there are issues with plugins
that only show up in certain situations.


I have other issues
-------------------

Try changing the renderer for your blog to the debug renderer.  You
can do this by setting the ``renderer`` property in your ``config.py``
file to ``debug``.  That will show a lot more detail about your configuration,
what the web-server passes PyBlosxom in environment variables, and other
data about your blog that might help you figure out what your problem is.



UGH!  My blog looks UGLY!
-------------------------

Read the chapter on *Flavours and Templates* to help you out.



I hate writing in HTML!
-----------------------

That's ok.  PyBlosxom supports entry parsers which allow you to format
your blog entries in any formatting markup that someone has written
a plugin for.  See the documentation on *Writing Entries* for more 
information.



Conclusion
